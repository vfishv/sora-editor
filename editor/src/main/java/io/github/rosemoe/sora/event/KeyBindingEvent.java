 * Keybinding event in editor.

 * when multiple keys are pressed at once.
 * For example, <b>Ctrl + X, Ctrl + D, Ctrl + Alt + O, etc.</b>

 * This event is dispatched <strong>after</strong> the {@link EditorKeyEvent}.
 * So, if any {@code EditorKeyEvent} consumes the event (sets the {@link InterceptTarget#TARGET_EDITOR} flag),
 * {@code KeyBindingEvent} will not be called.
